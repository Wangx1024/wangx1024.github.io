Greetings🧚🏻‍♀️, I'm Xudong Wang, currently pursuing my Ph.D. at McGill University in Canada. My research centers on harnessing the power of** data-driven machine learning methods** for the spatiotemporal data analysis, especially focus on traffic data. Within this captivating field, I'm particularly driven by three research topics:
- Imputing Missing Values
- Uncovering Dynamic Patterns
- Detecting Abnormal Behaviors

I'm deeply enthusiastic about the transformative potential of machine learning in these areas and am committed to advancing our comprehension of spatiotemporal data through my ongoing research endeavors.
