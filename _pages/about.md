Greetings, I'm Xudong Wang, currently pursuing my Ph.D. at McGill University in Canada. My research centers on harnessing the power of data-driven machine learning methods for the analysis of spatiotemporal data. Within this captivating field, I'm particularly driven by three overarching objectives:

- Imputing Missing Values
- Uncovering Dynamic Patterns
- Detecting Abnormal Behaviors

I'm deeply enthusiastic about the transformative potential of machine learning in these areas and am committed to advancing our comprehension of spatiotemporal data through my ongoing research endeavors.
